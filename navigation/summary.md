### Impact of Teachings

Teachings have fostered critical thinking, technical skills, and confidence, preparing us to tackle complex challenges. These teachings have helped us in practical applications, such as [Python Examples](https://darsh220.github.io/darsh_2025/2024/09/11/GitHub_Playground_IPYNB_2_.html) and [JavaScript Examples](https://darsh220.github.io/darsh_2025/2024/10/07/3.1_IPYNB_2_.html).

### Contributions in Lessons

Each student has contributed uniquely, enhancing our learning through peer teaching, collaboration, and innovative solutions. For instance, contributions during [Popcorn Hack Usage](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/portfolio_2025/csp/big-idea/p2/3-10-3) demonstrated creative problem-solving.
