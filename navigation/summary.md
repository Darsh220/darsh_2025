This document provides a brief overview of assignments, the grading process, and the impact of our teachings during Sprint 2.

### Homework Highlights

Homework assignments reinforce our understanding and encourage independent exploration, enhancing practical coding skills. [View Homework Summaries and Details](https://darsh220.github.io/darsh_2025/2024/10/10/Lesson_Summary_IPYNB_2_.html). [More](https://darsh220.github.io/darsh_2025/)

### Grading Process

The grading process is transparent, focusing on mastery of concepts and providing constructive feedback to guide improvement. [Learn more about the Grading Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZMkNop2b3HTsq-oZ-MgjCy76JJZwghmb5oEgCcYVHak/edit).

### Impact of Teachings

Teachings have fostered critical thinking, technical skills, and confidence, preparing us to tackle complex challenges. These teachings have helped us in practical applications, such as [Python Examples](https://darsh220.github.io/darsh_2025/2024/09/11/GitHub_Playground_IPYNB_2_.html) and [JavaScript Examples](https://darsh220.github.io/darsh_2025/2024/10/07/3.1_IPYNB_2_.html).

### Contributions in Lessons

Each student has contributed uniquely, enhancing our learning through peer teaching, collaboration, and innovative solutions. For instance, contributions during [Popcorn Hack Usage](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/portfolio_2025/csp/big-idea/p2/3-10-3) demonstrated creative problem-solving.

### Summary of the Checklist 
#### Relevancy to College Board 
- Most concepts learnt in this class are useful and I have made summaries of each lesson so that I can refer to them and use them for my studies for the AP exam as a refresher. The lesson summaries are listed in the link above for each lessons with definitve examples. 

### Key Takeaways 
- Throughout the lessons, I was able to understand and learn CSS and HTML as a beginner and I was also able to learn basic coding and web page development which has helped me develop as a problem solver and a critical thinker in this class.
