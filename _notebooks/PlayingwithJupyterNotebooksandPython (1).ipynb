      "Firefighters are battling an eruption of wild🔥s in the western United States this weekend, with flames ravaging thousands of acres and triggering evacuation orders across California, Oregon and Nevada. Line Fire The quick-moving Line Fire in Southern California exploded over the weekend, consuming more than 20,500 acres as of late Sunday and forcing evacuations amid a searing heat wave in the region. It was zero percent contained as of just after 9 p.m. Sunday, authorities said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The blaze in San Bernardino County, which ignited late last week, quadrupled in size as the weekend began, scorching thousands of acres on Saturday alone. The flames raced up steep terrain, chewing through thick vegetation as they approached Running Springs, a mountain community of about 5,000 people that lies between the populated resort areas of Lake Arrowhead and Big Bear Lake. The community has been ordered to evacuate, while Lake Arrowhead and areas to its west are under an evacuation warning. By Sunday evening, Cal Fire estimated that the blaze threatened more than 36,000 structures, including family homes and businesses.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Evacuation orders are also in effect on the 🔽 side of the 🔥, while structures could be affected in the city of Highland, which lies at the base of the mountains in San Bernardino County. Three 🔥fighters had been injured battling the blaze as of Sunday afternoon, according to a Cal Fire incident update. “Hot and dry conditions mixed with thunderstorms are expected to challenge 🔥fighters for the next few days,” the update stated.\n",

      "Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) proclaimed a state of emergency in the county to secure federal assistance to respond to the 🔥, which is threatening homes as well as critical infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 🔥 has “room to grow now in essentially three directions and there are population centers and pretty dense, dry vegetation in between those population centers,” UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain said in a Saturday briefing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 🔥 initially sparked Thursday and had burned about 3,800 acres by Saturday morning, before ballooning thousands of acres through the afternoon. The blaze was so intense that it also formed a towering pyrocumulonimbus cloud — a 🔥-generated thunderstorm — that was sending out its own lightning, erratic winds and brief rain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Line Fire is spreading amid a scorching heat wave in Southern California that has rivaled one seen in September 2020, with temperatures approaching or tying all-time records, exceeding 105 and even 110 degrees in many locations.\n",

      "\n",

      "The Boyles Fire in Clearlake, in Lake County, has burned through about 76 acres and was about 10 percent contained as of Sunday evening. Authorities issued evacuation orders for two parts of the town, displacing at least 4,000 of its approximately 17,000 residents.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Cal Fire, which posted a Sunday night update from the Lake County Fire Protection District, the blaze has “impacted” about 30 structures, although it is too soon to assess the damage. It has also destroyed more than 40 vehicles, the agency said.\n",

      "In Nevada, strong, dry winds helped propel the Davis Fire 🔽 of Reno to roughly 6,500 acres, sparking a state of emergency declaration. Roughly 20,000 people have been evacuated ahead of the flames, according to the declaration from Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo (R).\n",

There are at least 70 large 🔥s burning out West, including 21 in Oregon, 19 in Idaho and 13 in Montana.
