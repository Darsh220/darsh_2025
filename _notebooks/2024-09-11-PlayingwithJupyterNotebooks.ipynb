      "Firefighters are battling an eruption of wild🔥s in the western United States this weekend, with flames ravaging thousands of acres and triggering evacuation orders across California, Oregon and Nevada. Line Fire The quick-moving Line Fire in Southern California exploded over the weekend, consuming more than 20,500 acres as of late Sunday and forcing evacuations amid a searing heat wave in the region. It was zero percent contained as of just after 9 p.m. Sunday, authorities said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The blaze in San Bernardino County, which ignited late last week, quadrupled in size as the weekend began, scorching thousands of acres on Saturday alone. The flames raced up steep terrain, chewing through thick vegetation as they approached Running Springs, a mountain community of about 5,000 people that lies between the populated resort areas of Lake Arrowhead and Big Bear Lake. The community has been ordered to evacuate, while Lake Arrowhead and areas to its west are under an evacuation warning. By Sunday evening, Cal Fire estimated that the blaze threatened more than 36,000 structures, including family homes and businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The San Bernardino County 🔥 quadrupled in size over the weekend, and Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has declared a state of emergency in the county. (Video: Menifee Battalion Chief via Storyful)\n",
      "\n",
      "Evacuation orders are also in effect on the 🔽 side of the 🔥, while structures could be affected in the city of Highland, which lies at the base of the mountains in San Bernardino County. Three 🔥fighters had been injured battling the blaze as of Sunday afternoon, according to a Cal Fire incident update. “Hot and dry conditions mixed with thunderstorms are expected to challenge 🔥fighters for the next few days,” the update stated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) proclaimed a state of emergency in the county to secure federal assistance to respond to the 🔥, which is threatening homes as well as critical infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 🔥 has “room to grow now in essentially three directions and there are population centers and pretty dense, dry vegetation in between those population centers,” UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain said in a Saturday briefing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 🔥 initially sparked Thursday and had burned about 3,800 acres by Saturday morning, before ballooning thousands of acres through the afternoon. The blaze was so intense that it also formed a towering pyrocumulonimbus cloud — a 🔥-generated thunderstorm — that was sending out its own lightning, erratic winds and brief rain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Line Fire is spreading amid a scorching heat wave in Southern California that has rivaled one seen in September 2020, with temperatures approaching or tying all-time records, exceeding 105 and even 110 degrees in many locations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",

      "Vegetation in the area is “critically dry,” according to the San Bernardino National Forest.\n",

      "“The San Bernardino front country … has everything you need for a 🔥 to get big,” retired Cal Fire assistant chief Tim Chavez said in an interview posted online by the Lookout, a wild🔥 reporting website.\n",
      "\n",
      "Along with this week’s heat, Chavez said, that includes heavy fuels that in most places haven’t burned since the 1990s — and “steep, steep terrain leading up to the mountain communities.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fuels that are stressed like that — they tend to surprise you,” he said.\n",

      "\n",
      "He compared the blaze to the El Dorado Fire, which sparked during the September 2020 heat wave, burning almost 23,000 acres in San Bernardino and Riverside counties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "“These 🔥s are occurring in light winds, but this one is a little more complicated because it had thunderstorms over it yesterday and likely today as well,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stormy skies cloud parts of the region, as monsoon thunderstorms in the area Saturday also helped to intensify the 🔥.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Unfortunately, the weather conditions over the next few days are not going to be favorable,” Swain said in the Saturday briefing. “It’s going to be very hot and relatively unstable over the next few days with some increasing winds next week.\n",

      "Cooler weather is expected to move in by midweek, but that transition could come with strong winds.\n",

      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "The Boyles Fire in Clearlake, in Lake County, has burned through about 76 acres and was about 10 percent contained as of Sunday evening. Authorities issued evacuation orders for two parts of the town, displacing at least 4,000 of its approximately 17,000 residents.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Cal Fire, which posted a Sunday night update from the Lake County Fire Protection District, the blaze has “impacted” about 30 structures, although it is too soon to assess the damage. It has also destroyed more than 40 vehicles, the agency said.\n",
