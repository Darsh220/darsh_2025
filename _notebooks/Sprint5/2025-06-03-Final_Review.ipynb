    "### **Reflection**\n",
    "- StudyBuddy turned out to be a solid project with useful features.\n",
    "- Faced challenges with user interactions and database management, which improved problem-solving and collaboration skills.\n",
    "- Group communication and collaboration improved significantly towards the end of the trimester.\n",
    "- Gained valuable knowledge in web development, backend functionality, and building practical, user-friendly applications.\n",
    "- Plan to major in mechanical engineering, but see computer science as a valuable side skill.\n",
    "- Coding knowledge will be useful for automation, simulations, data analysis, and engineering projects.\n",
    "- Even if CompSci isnâ€™t pursued as a career, coding will be helpful for future engineering research and personal projects.\n",
