    "### Facts API Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "This API allows users to manage \"facts\" associated with individuals. It includes endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting facts, as well as an initialization function to populate sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model: Facts\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Facts` model represents an individual fact entry in the database. It contains the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `id`: (Integer) Primary key, auto-incremented.\n",
    "- `_name`: (String) The name of the individual. Must be unique and non-null.\n",
    "- `_fact`: (String) The fact associated with the individual. Must be unique and non-null.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `create()`\n",
    "- **Description**: Adds the current instance of `Facts` to the database and commits the transaction.\n",
    "- **Raises**: Rolls back the transaction and raises an exception if an error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `read()`\n",
    "- **Description**: Returns the fact's data as a dictionary containing `id`, `name`, and `fact`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `update(users)`\n",
    "- **Description**: Commits changes to the database.\n",
    "- **Raises**: Rolls back the transaction and raises an exception if an error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `delete()`\n",
    "- **Description**: Deletes the current instance of `Facts` from the database and commits the transaction.\n",
    "- **Raises**: Rolls back the transaction and raises an exception if an error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `restore(data)`\n",
    "- **Static Method**: Restores facts from a given dataset by creating new entries or updating existing ones based on the `_name` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adding Information (POST Request):**\n",
    "  - New users access the site, which is initially empty.\n",
    "  - They fill it in with a fact of their liking.\n",
    "  - A POST request is sent to store the fact in the database and generate a unique user ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loading Information (GET Request):**\n",
    "  - A GET request is triggered when the facts page is reloaded.\n",
    "  - Retrieves user facts from the database.\n",
    "  - Displays the facts based on the current user's id.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Updating Information (PUT Request):**\n",
    "  - Users can edit facts in the database.\n",
    "  - A PUT request is sent to update their facts in the database with the updated info and user ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deleting Information (DELETE Request):**\n",
    "  - Users can choose to remove their facts from the database.\n",
    "  - A DELETE request is sent to remove facts from the database. \n",
