       "Paul David Hewson (born 10 May 1960), known by the nickname Bono ( BON-oh), is an Irish singer-songwriter and activist. He is the lead vocalist and primary lyricist of the rock band U2.\n",
       "Born and raised in Dublin, Ireland, he attended Mount Temple Comprehensive School where in 1976 he began dating his future wife, Alison Stewart, as well as forming, with schoolmates, the band that became U2.  Bono soon established himself as a passionate frontman for the band through his expressive vocal style and grandiose gestures and songwriting. His lyrics frequently include social and political themes, and religious imagery inspired by his Christian beliefs. During U2's early years, Bono's lyrics contributed to the group's rebellious and spiritual tone. As the band matured, his lyrics became inspired more by personal experiences shared with the other members. As a member of U2, Bono has received 22 Grammy Awards and has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n",
       "Aside from his music, Bono is an activist for social justice causes, both through U2 and as an individual. He is particularly active in campaigning to fight extreme poverty and HIV/AIDS in Africa, for which he co-founded DATA, EDUN, the ONE Campaign, and Product Red. In pursuit of these causes, he has participated in benefit concerts and lobbied politicians and heads of state for relief. Bono has been honoured for his philanthropic efforts. In 2005, Bono was named one of the Time Persons of the Year. He was granted an honorary knighthood by Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom in 2007 for \"his services to the music industry and for his humanitarian work\", and was made a Commandeur of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (Order of Arts and Letters) in 2013. Bono has also attracted criticism for bypassing African businesses in his activist efforts and for tax avoidance in his personal finances.\n",
       "Outside the band, he has recorded with numerous artists. He has collaborated with U2 bandmate the Edge on several projects, including: songs for Roy Orbison, Tina Turner, and Martin Garrix; and the soundtracks to the musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark and a London stage adaptation of A Clockwork Orange. In business, he invested in the refurbishment of the Clarence Hotel in Dublin, and was managing director and a managing partner of the private equity firm Elevation Partners, which invested in several companies."

       "The chimpanzee (; Pan troglodytes), also simply known as the chimp, is a species of great ape native to the forests and savannahs of tropical Africa. It has four confirmed subspecies and a fifth proposed one. When its close relative the bonobo was more commonly known as the pygmy chimpanzee, this species was often called the common chimpanzee or the robust chimpanzee. The chimpanzee and the bonobo are the only species in the genus Pan. Evidence from fossils and DNA sequencing shows that Pan is a sister taxon to the human lineage and is thus humans' closest living relative. The chimpanzee is covered in coarse black hair, but has a bare face, fingers, toes, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. It is larger and more robust than the bonobo, weighing 40–70 kg (88–154 lb) for males and 27–50 kg (60–110 lb) for females and standing 150 cm (4 ft 11 in).\n",
       "The chimpanzee lives in groups that range in size from 15 to 150 members, although individuals travel and forage in much smaller groups during the day. The species lives in a strict male-dominated hierarchy, where disputes are generally settled without the need for violence. Nearly all chimpanzee populations have been recorded using tools, modifying sticks, rocks, grass and leaves and using them for hunting and acquiring honey, termites, ants, nuts and water. The species has also been found creating sharpened sticks to spear small mammals. Its gestation period is eight months. The infant is weaned at about three years old but usually maintains a close relationship with its mother for several years more.\n",
       "The chimpanzee is listed on the IUCN Red List as an endangered species. Between 170,000 and 300,000 individuals are estimated across its range. The biggest threats to the chimpanzee are habitat loss, poaching, and disease. Chimpanzees appear in Western popular culture as stereotyped clown-figures and have featured in entertainments such as chimpanzees' tea parties, circus acts and stage shows. Although many chimpanzees have been kept as pets, their strength, aggression, and unpredictability makes them dangerous in this role. Some hundreds have been kept in laboratories for research, especially in the United States. Many attempts have been made to teach languages such as American Sign Language to chimpanzees, with limited success."

      "A quick-moving blaze in Southern California exploded this weekend, consuming more than 17,000 acres as of early Sunday and forcing evacuations amid a searing heat wave in the region. The Line Fire in San Bernardino County, which ignited late last week, quadrupled in size as the weekend began, scorching thousands of acres on Saturday alone. The flames raced up steep terrain, chewing through thick vegetation as they approached Running Springs, a mountain community of about 5,000 people that lies between the populated resort areas of Lake Arrowhead and Big Bear Lake. The community has been ordered to evacuate, while Lake Arrowhead and areas to its west are under an evacuation warning.\n",

      "The 🔥 has “room to grow now in essentially three directions and there are population centers and pretty dense, dry vegetation in between those population centers,” UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain said in a Saturday briefing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 🔥 initially sparked Thursday and had burned about 3,800 acres by Saturday morning, before ballooning thousands of acres through the afternoon.

      "The 🔥 is spreading amid a scorching heat wave in Southern California that has rivaled one seen in September 2020, with temperatures approaching or tying all-time records, exceeding 105 and even 110 degrees in many locations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Vegetation in the area is “critically dry,” according to the San Bernardino National Forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The San Bernardino front country … has everything you need for a 🔥 to get big,” retired Cal Fire assistant chief Tim Chavez said in an interview posted online by the Lookout, a wild🔥 reporting website.\n",
      "\n",
      "Along with this week’s heat, Chavez said, that includes heavy fuels that in most places haven’t burned since the 1990s — and “steep, steep terrain leading up to the mountain communities.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fuels that are stressed like that — they tend to surprise you,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Temperatures at the base of the 🔥 have been running about 105-110 degrees each day this weekend, Alex Tardy, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in San Diego, said in an email.\n",
      "\n",
      "He compared the blaze to the El Dorado Fire which sparked during the September 2020 heat wave, burning almost 23,000 acres in San Bernardino and Riverside counties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "“These 🔥s are occurring in light winds, but this one is a little more complicated because it had thunderstorms over it yesterday and likely today as well,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stormy skies cloud parts of the region, as monsoon thunderstorms in the area on Saturday also helped to intensify the 🔥. Officials are expecting Sunday to be another day of 🔥 growth and erratic 🔥 behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Unfortunately, the weather conditions over the next few days are not going to be favorable,” Swain said in the Saturday briefing. “It’s going to be very hot and relatively unstable over the next few days with some increasing winds next week.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Cooler weather is expected to move in by midweek, but that transition could come with strong winds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the wind-driven Davis Fire 🔽 of Reno, Nev., has burned at least 3,300 acres since sparking Saturday, destroying at least six structures. It was spreading quickly again on Sunday, forcing new evacuations. And amid hot and dry conditions across California, other 🔥s have sparked, including the fast-growing Boyles Fire northwest of Sacramento that’s burning through heavy brush in Lake County, triggering mandatory evacuations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Strong, dry winds of 30 to 40 mph are expected Sunday as a weather disturbance passes through the region. The conditions are a major 🔥 weather risk for the Sierra Front, according to the National Weather Service at Reno, and a red-flag warning is in effect for western Nevada into eastern California from 11 a.m. until 8 p.m. Sunday, given the potential for fast-spreading blazes.\n"
