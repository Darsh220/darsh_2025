    "### Digital Divide Homework Hack\n",
    "\n",
    "- In my community, the digital divide is most noticeable in lower-income neighborhoods, where many families lack reliable internet  access and up-to-date devices for school and work.\n",
    "- Rural areas also face challenges, as spotty broadband coverage makes it difficult for students and remote workers to stay connected.\n",

    "- To help bridge this gap, I can volunteer at local libraries or community centers to teach basic digital skills and internet safety.\n",
    "- Additionally, I can advocate for policies that expand affordable broadband access and support initiatives that provide free or low-cost devices to underserved populations.\n",
