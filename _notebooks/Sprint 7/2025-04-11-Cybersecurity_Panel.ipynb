    "## Cybersecurity Panel Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cybersecurity: What It Is\n",
    "Cybersecurity involves the protection of **data**, **systems**, and **networks** from unauthorized access, attacks, or damage. It’s a critical field that helps safeguard the integrity of sensitive information, ensuring that digital systems remain functional and secure from various threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Panelists\n",
    "- **David Tomasz**\n",
    "- **Tricia Mercer**\n",
    "- **Victor Nzeata**\n",
    "\n",
    "### A little about the panelists\n",
    "- **David Tomasz**\n",
    "    - Intelligence Analyst David Tomasz works in FBI San Diego’s cybercriminal squad to extract critical intelligence from ongoing criminal investigations and study emerging cybercriminal threats. He is a ransomware subject matter expert and frequent presenter on and the cyberthreat landscape. IA Tomasz is also an inaugural member of the San Diego Cyber Council and works to support investigations into cybercriminal activity in San Diego and Imperial County\n",
    "- **Tricia Mercer**\n",

    "### Key Points from the Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hackers and Mistakes\n",
    "- Many hackers are caught due to **small mistakes** they make. These mistakes often expose them to **ethical hackers** and **cybersecurity specialists** like David Tomasz. Ethical hackers use these vulnerabilities to find weaknesses in systems before malicious hackers can exploit them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Internal Threats in Corporations\n",
    "- In addition to external threats, **internal threats** can pose a significant risk to large corporations. Employees, contractors, or others with access to critical systems can inadvertently or maliciously compromise security from within.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hackers and Financial Risks\n",
    "- One major concern in cybersecurity is the threat posed by **hackers aiming to compromise corporate security** in order to steal money or valuable data. The financial impact of such breaches can be devastating for businesses and their customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Role of AI in Cybersecurity\n",
    "- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** can be a double-edged sword in cybersecurity. While AI can be used to bolster security systems, it can also be used by cybercriminals to **exploit vulnerabilities** and outpace traditional defense mechanisms, making AI itself a real threat to cybersecurity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Zero-Day Vulnerabilities\n",
    "- A **zero-day vulnerability** refers to a **flaw in software** that is unknown to the developers and has no available patch. Zero-day exploits can be extremely dangerous because they leave **many corporations vulnerable** until the issue is discovered and fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ethical Hacking\n",
    "- **Ethical hacking** is different from malicious hacking. It involves the same techniques used by hackers, but the goal is to identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities in order to protect systems from real-world attacks. Ethical hackers work within legal boundaries to prevent harm to organizations and individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Career Choices in Cybersecurity\n",
    "- **Sometimes people end up majoring in topics they don't love**, like Mr. Tomasz, who shared his experience in the field. His story serves as a reminder that career paths can evolve, and sometimes people find a passion for a subject later on, even if they didn’t initially plan for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Should Computer Science (CS) Students Do?\n",
    "- **Build a solid background in IT**: Understanding the fundamentals of information technology (IT) is crucial. Students should take an interest in **how computers work**—the various components, hardware, software, and how systems interact.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Explore different areas in tech**: It’s important to have hands-on experience with various aspects of technology, from hardware to software development. Experimenting with different tools, systems, and applications helps build a strong foundation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Build connections**: Networking with professionals in the field, attending cybersecurity events, and participating in tech meetups can help students understand industry trends and grow their career opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understand the essentials for CSP (Cybersecurity Professionals)**: Students should familiarize themselves with the core skills and certifications required for a career in cybersecurity. This includes learning about firewalls, encryption, risk management, and other essential security protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Do a lot of technical work**: Practical experience is key. Engaging in personal projects, contributing to open-source cybersecurity projects, or even ethical hacking challenges can provide valuable experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenges in Cybersecurity Careers\n",
    "- **Being very technical with employers**: One challenge many cybersecurity professionals face is the need to explain technical concepts to non-technical employers or businesspeople. It’s important to **simplify** and **clarify complex topics** without oversimplifying the risks involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Communication is key**: When dealing with employers or business leaders, cybersecurity professionals need to be **blunt and direct** about the importance of security and the potential risks involved. Cybersecurity often requires making tough decisions that prioritize security over convenience or cost.\n"
