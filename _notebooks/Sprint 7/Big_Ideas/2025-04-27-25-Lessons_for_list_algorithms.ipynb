    "#### Benefits of Using Lists\n",
    "1. **Orderly Storage**: Lists help store multiple items in an orderly manner, preserving the sequence.\n",
    "2. **Easy Access**: You can easily access and modify elements using an index.\n",
    "3. **Dynamic Size**: Unlike arrays, lists can dynamically grow or shrink in size.\n",
    "4. **Efficient Searching**: Lists allow for fast searching of elements, especially in sorted or indexed forms.\n",
    "5. **Versatile**: Lists can store elements of any data type, making them highly versatile.\n",
    "6. **Iterability**: Lists can be looped through, making them ideal for repetitive tasks or processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Examples of Lists in Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shopping Cart** (E-commerce sites):  \n",
    "   A list can store all the items added to a shopping cart, such as:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   shopping_cart = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"chocolate\", \"toothpaste\"]\n"

    "### 1. **Spam Email Filters**\n",
    "   - **Description**: Email services like Gmail use filtering algorithms to classify emails as spam or not based on content and patterns.\n",
    "   - **Example**: Gmail’s spam filter which flags emails containing suspicious keywords or known spam addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Content Recommendation Systems**\n",
    "   - **Description**: Streaming platforms like Netflix use filtering algorithms to recommend movies and shows based on user preferences and viewing history.\n",
    "   - **Example**: Netflix’s recommendation system that suggests content like “Top Picks for You” based on past views.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **E-commerce Product Filters**\n",
    "   - **Description**: Online stores like Amazon use filtering algorithms to help users narrow product choices by attributes such as price, brand, and customer ratings.\n",
    "   - **Example**: Amazon’s product filtering system where users can sort by price, reviews, or availability.\n"

    "#### List Procedures:\n",
    "#### 1. Append a new item to the list\n",
    "items.append(\"stapler\")  # Adding 'stapler' to the list\n",
    "#### 2. Remove an item from the list\n",

    "#### 3. Insert an item at a specific index\n",
