    "- **[About](http://127.0.0.1:4100/darsh_2025/about/)**: Was the first ever checkpoint in the coding journey and helped me understannd basic formatting using markdown and html\n",
    "- **[Github Playground](https://darsh220.github.io/darsh_2025/2024/09/11/GitHub_Playground_IPYNB_2_.html)**: Was tje first test of our knowledge but helped me understand and play around with python a bit more along with javascript\n",
    "- **[Frontend](http://127.0.0.1:4100/darsh_2025/2024/09/19/Hacks_Frontend_IPYNB_2_.html)**: This was built up on the information learnt before and I was able to discover many more ways in which I could experiment with hacks and make them useful in real world applications\n",
    "- **[Self Teaching Lesson](http://127.0.0.1:4100/darsh_2025/2024/09/25/big-idea-3-10-3_IPYNB_2_.html)**: Was a summary of all my information incorporated into a lesson to teach others and this helped me understand some flaws and some strengths that I had in my code and my lessons. \n",

    "- **[Running the Webpage](http://127.0.0.1:4100/darsh_2025/)**: Using the information provided by Mr Mort we were able to get a successful webpage running which wqould be the main foundational basis for all porojects done in the class\n",
    "- **About Page**: This was another important marker in the CSP course as it was the first real introduction to the basic tools that we were going to implement in our webpage like github and VScode tools which were helpful.\n",
    "- **[The first Issue Created](https://github.com/Darsh220/darsh_2025/issues/1)**: This shows the first issue we created as this was also important in this class as it helped us understand a mode of expresing yourselves and communicating with your fellow peers in Github.\n",
    "- **[The first pull request Created](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/portfolio_2025/pull/204)**: This was our group's first pull request and helped us understand how one single format error means a lot and how our code could be integrated into Mr Mort's lessons. \n",
